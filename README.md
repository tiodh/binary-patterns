# Binary Patterns Package
The package provides a comprehensive suite of Local Binary Pattern (LBP) variants, specifically designed for advanced image analysis and texture recognition tasks. It includes three key variants: **Co-occurrence Local Binary Pattern (Co-LBP)**, **Multi-block Local Binary Pattern (MBLBP)**, and **Opponent Dominant Local Binary Pattern (OD-LBP)**, each tailored to enhance the feature extraction capabilities in different scenarios.

## Co-occurrence Local Binary Pattern (Co-LBP)
This variant focuses on capturing the co-occurrence statistics of LBP labels over a specified neighborhood. It is particularly useful in scenarios where texture and spatial relationships between pixels are crucial for accurate classification or analysis.

## Multi-block Local Binary Pattern (MBLBP)
MBLBP extends the traditional LBP by considering multiple surrounding blocks of pixels rather than just the immediate neighbors. This approach allows for a more robust representation of local structures, making it highly effective in environments with significant texture variations.

## Opponent Dominant Local Binary Pattern (OD-LBP)
OD-LBP is designed to exploit the contrast between opposing pixel pairs within a neighborhood. This method enhances the ability to detect edge-like features and is particularly beneficial in applications requiring high sensitivity to edge information.

This package is ideal for researchers and developers working in the fields of computer vision, image processing, and machine learning, providing them with powerful tools to handle a wide range of image analysis tasks. Whether it's for academic research or practical applications, this collection of LBP variants offers a versatile and efficient solution for extracting meaningful features from images.
